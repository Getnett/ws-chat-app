# Chat Application like Omegle

The purpose of this project is to learn more about Socket.IO and explore its different use cases. I created this chat app to practice what I’ve learned. Please note that not all concepts in Socket.IO are covered—for example, *rooms*, which allow isolated chats between subsets of clients, are not implemented but would offer a more practical aspect.

Additionally, I’ve integrated RabbitMQ as a messaging queue to demonstrate message scaling and reliable delivery.

## How to Use the Application

- Use a Dockerized RabbitMQ instance.
- Start the server:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
- Start the client:
  ``` bash 
  npm install
  npm run dev
